This is Ian's attempt to learn Emacs.

I've been told to go with GNU Emacs version 23 or greater.

The best OS X port seems to be http://emacsformacosx.com/

TIPS:
- C-u 0 M-x byte-recompile-directory

TODO
- Try ECB and CEDET
- Fix editing in CSS mode - ending lines with ; and }
- Git mode
- Support per-host local init file
- Load ropemacs when Python is >2.5
- Make M-; comment current line if region is inactive
